Livecolor splashing, sloshing from sidewalk to sidewalk
Driven by currents of lust fear hope obligation

All movement channeled
Through those bodies these fractured vessels
Riven by demands, by pressures instigated
During one night's mistake borne through long years'
Acquaintance with the weight of a broom a steering wheel a pick and shovel.

What do these bodies speak when they speak to me?
Spanish in chichicatenango, but no hola here.

Here the straightedged beauty of simple function
Of an errand accomplished of successful consumption.

What do they speak? javanese in jakarta.
Marathi in mumbai. when they greet me in turkish in berlin
Are they speaking to themselves or to me?

We feast on our own lives in these streets;
Polycultural cannibalism wallowing in its own monohued blood.
